# RoboArmLinux

### Description

 Portfolio and educational project.
 The main goal of that was creating simple and cheap multipurpose arm for use in many other projects. It features a control panel made in Qt. Project    utilises open-access Linux libraries.

### Requires

 - Linux with desktop environment
 - Qt creator (I used 7.0.2)
 - Pico SDK (default configuration)
 - (for Qt) Your system has to have a global acces to consecutive libraries: stdio.h, string.h, iostream ,
 fcntl.h , errno.h, termios.h, unistd.h, cstdint, stdlib.h
 - (for Pico) Your system has to have a global acces to consecutive libraries: stdlib.h, pico/stdlib.h, stdio.h
 - super user permissions
 - Cmake and make(makefile) buildsystem
  
  
### SetUp

 (PC) Control panel run with Qt creator. It required only default configured Qt.
 
 (Pico-software) In order to save a time I took ready example hello_world from pico and I remodel everything what I needed.
 In order to compile the program you have to go to specified directory and use command `make -j4` and move ready *.uf2 file to rp pico.

 (Pico-hardware) By default 6 gpio pins are used to control the servos. I set range for pins from 10th to 15th(also included) to control.
 number of pin refers to gpio numbering.

 
### Warnings

 Raspbery pi pico retrive and send data by usb port, so you have to turn off uart option in your Cmakefile.txt.
 Qt control panel will send data to ttyACM0 by default, the path have to be changed manualy in program in Qt.


### Limits
 Project uses weak servos so in showed model the power of arm is not super enought, so keep in mind it is not good option for real industry usage.
